        <h2>About</h2>
        <img id="profile" src="images/ney.jpg"></img>
        <p>She is currently a software engineering student at UCI who loves to program in C++. She might be starting to like javascript
          a bit because of the visually appealing stuff it can do (thanks to her senpai Dean). But apart from that, she works as a Lead
          Counselor at Connected Camps and loves working and teaching engineering concepts to children by using Minecraft. Did I mention
          she loves games too? She mostly plays Minecraft and Overwatch but is a big fan of JRPGs. Other hobbies include baking her
          favorite sweets (fruit tarts and french macarons) and writing fantasy stories that she can never seem to finish. One more thing
          she's into is anything about space and the Universe. She likes learning about stars, light, and quantum mechanics. She likes
          space so much she bought a NASA shirt and sticker at the Johnson Space Center and has watched Cosmos and The Universe multiple
          times. Wow this is getting long. Other than all that, she's a pretty chill and optimistic person who apparently likes to write
          in third person to describe herself. Oh, speak of the devil. She said to say "Nice to meet you!" to all of you.</p>
